		<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
		<para>
			<command>jack-keyboard</command> is a virtual MIDI keyboard - a program that allows
			you to send JACK MIDI events (play ;-) using your PC keyboard.  It's
			somewhat similar to <command>vkeybd</command>, except it uses JACK MIDI instead of
			ALSA, and the default keyboard mapping is much better - it uses the same
			layout as trackers (like Impulse Tracker) did, so you have two and
			half octaves under your fingers.
		</para>
	</refsect1>

	<refsect1>
		<title>KEY BINDINGS</title>
		<para>
			Keyboard mapping is the same as in Impulse Tracker.  This is your
			QWERTY keyboard:

		<screen>
		   +----+----+    +----+----+----+    +----+----+
		   | 2  | 3  |    | 5  | 6  | 7  |    | 9  | 0  |
		+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
		| Q  | W  | E  | R  | T  | Y  | U  | I  | O  | P  |
		+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
		       | S  | D  |    | G  | H  | J  |
		    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
		    | Z  | X  | C  | V  | B  | N  | M  |
		    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
		</screen>

		And this is MIDI mapping:

		<screen>
		   +----+----+    +----+----+----+    +----+----+
		   |C#5 |D#5 |    |F#5 |G#5 |A#5 |    |C#6 |D#6 |
		+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
		| C5 | D5 | E5 | F5 | G5 | A5 | B5 | C6 | D6 | E6 |
		+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
		       |C#4 |D#4 |    |F#4 |G#4 |A#4 |
		    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
		    | C4 | D4 | E4 | F4 | G4 | A4 | B4 |
		    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
		</screen>

		</para>

		<para>
			Spacebar is a sustain key.  Holding it when pressing or releasing key
			will make that key sustained, i.e. Note Off MIDI event won't be sent
			after releasing the key.  To release (stop) all the sustained notes,
			press and release spacebar.
		</para>

		<para>
			Holding Shift when pressing note will make it louder (it increases
			velocity).  Holding Ctrl will do the opposite.  You can change the
			default velocity by moving the Velocity slider.  You can change the "high"
			and "low" velocity values by moving the slider while holding Shift
			or Ctrl keys.
		</para>

		<para>Pressing "-" and "+"
			keys on numeric keypad changes the octave your keyboard is mapped to.
			Pressing "*" and "/" on numeric keypad changes
			MIDI program (instrument).  Pressing Insert or Delete keys will
			connect <command>jack-keyboard</command> to the next/previous MIDI input port (it will cycle between running
			instances of ghostess, for example).  Home and End keys change the MIDI channel.
			Page Up and Page Down keys switch the MIDI bank.
		</para>
		<para>
			Esc works as a panic key - when you press it, all sound stops.
		</para>
	</refsect1>

	<refsect1>
		<title>SETTING CHANNEL/BANK/PROGRAM NUMBER DIRECTLY</title>
		<para>
			To switch directly to a channel, bank or program, enter its number on the numeric
			keypad (it won't be shown in any way) and press Home or End (to change channel),
			Page Up or Page Down (to change bank) or "/" or "*"
			(to change program).  For example, to change to program number 123,
			type, on the numeric keypad, "123/", without quotes.
		</para>
	</refsect1>

	<refsect1>
		<title>TITLEBAR</title>
		<para>
			When <option>-G</option> xor <option>-T</option> is given, some informational
			messages in the title bar appear. They are supposed to be self explanatory.
		       	If you see "bank/program change not sent",
			it means that the bank/program numbers as seen in the title bar were not sent.  In other words,
			synth the <command>jack-keyboard</command> is connected to may use different values.  This happens
			at startup and after switching between synths (using Insert/Delete keys).  To send bank/program
			change at startup, use <option>-b</option> and <option>-p</option> parameters.  To automatically
			send bank/program change after reconnect, use the <option>-u</option> option.
		</para>
	</refsect1>

	<refsect1>
		<title>PIANOLA MODE</title>
		<para>
			In addition to the MIDI output port, <command>jack-keyboard</command> also opens MIDI input (listening) port.
			MIDI events going into this port will be passed to the output port unmodified, except for channel number,
			which will be set to the one <command>jack-keyboard</command> is configured to use.  Note On and Note Off
			MIDI events will cause visible effect (pressing and releasing) on keys, just like if they were being pressed
			using keyboard or mouse.
		</para>
		<para>
			<command>jack-keyboard</command> will never connect to it's own MIDI input port.  It will also refuse
			to connect to any other client whose name begins with "jack-keyboard", unless the "\-k" option is given.
			It is, however, possible to connect these ports manually, using <command>jack_connect</command>
			or <command>qjackctl</command>; this may create feedback loop.
		</para>

		<title>BUGS</title>
		<para>
			Key grabbing is unreliable.
		</para>

		<para>
			Many PC keyboards have problems with polyphony.  For example, with the one I'm using right now,
			it's impossible to press "c", "v" and "b" at the same time.  It's a hardware problem, not the
			software one.
		</para>

		<para>
			The spin widgets used to set channel/bank/program number don't take focus, so the value cannot be entered
			into them in the usual way.  It's because <command>jack-keyboard</command> already uses numeric keys
			for different purposes.  You can still directly enter channel/bank/program in a way described above.
		</para>
